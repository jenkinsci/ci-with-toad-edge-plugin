[[ContinuousIntegrationWithToadEdgePlugin-Introduction]]
== Introduction

This plugin allows user to automate Database Lifecycle Management tasks
from within Jenkins. Following tasks are available:

. Compare database schemas - Compare two different schemas (from
database, model or snapshot). Based on it you can do in the next steps
further actions (like generating report or alter script)
. Compare database with baseline - Compare your current schema with
baseline. In case the schema is different the build step will fail.
. Create baseline - Set the current state of your schema as the baseline
to detect any changes that has been made into the schema since now.
. Create snapshot - Save your database schema to a file to have the
possibility to return to it later.
. Deploy SQL script - Run any arbitrary SQL script on a selected
database.
. Generate Jenkins HTML comparison report - Generate a HTML report based
on a previous schema compare build step. This report is accessible via
build detail within build history in Jenkins.
. Generate standalone HTML comparison report - Generate a HTML report
based on a previous schema compare build step. 
. Generate change SQL script - Generate an alter SQL script based on a
previous schema compare build step.
. Generate create SQL script - Generate a create SQL script from your
VCS repository, saved snapshot or database.

== Troubleshooting

[[ContinuousIntegrationWithToadEdgePlugin-Documentation]]
=== Jenkins HTML comparison report rendering issues

If you are having issues viewing Jenkins HTML comparison report, it could be due to your browser's Content Security Policy. You can check your browser console to confirm the same.
Also, the reports will not get rendered if Jenkins's https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/user-content/#resource-root-url[resource root url] is configured.

To view Jenkins HTML reports, you would have to relax the CSP. This can be done by going to _Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Script Console_

*Run this script to relax CSP:*

`System.setProperty("hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "default-src 'self'; script-src * 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src * data:");`

This will be reverted once Jenkins restarts

_Please note that we would also suggest you to review https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/configuring-content-security-policy/ and https://content-security-policy.com/ to understand the nature of CSP and the protection which it offers before changing CSP._

However, if you are reluctant to relax your CSP. We would recommend you to generate only standalone HTML comparison report. These reports can be found inside your chosen output folder.

=== Input folder/file path restrictions during job configuration

From plugin version 2.4, all folder and file paths should be inside the agent node where the job is running. Paths to master node and other remote nodes won't work.
